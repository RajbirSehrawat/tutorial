    a -> [5, 4, -11, 7, 8, 0]
	b -> [2, 7, 1, 0, 9]

	for n in a:
	  if 9-n in b:
	     print n, 


    employee
id    name    manager  performance    salary
1    a        -        8            100
2    b        1        9            50
3    c        1        9            80
4    d        -        10           110
5    e        4        9            90

===========

employe


SELECT (salary) FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC Limit 1,1

SELECT name, salary from employee where salary in (SELECT (salary) FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC Limit 1,1)


SELECT m.name FROM empoyee m, employee e WHERE

SELECT SUM(e.performance) as total, m.name as name FROM employee as e, employee as m GROUP BY m.manager where e.id=m.manager ORDER BY total DESC 1


select name from employee where performance > 8

select name from employee where performance > 8 and salary < 100

select name from employee where performance > 8 and salary < 100 and manager is not null
