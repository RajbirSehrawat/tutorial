Frozen a set
To make a set immutable, you use the built-in function called frozenset(). The frozenset() returns a new immutable set from an existing one. For example:

skills = {'Problem solving', 'Software design', 'Python programming'}
skills = frozenset(skills)
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
After that, if you attempt to modify elements of the set, youâ€™ll get an error:


SET
