5. What is dictionary. What can be dictionary keys. How Dictionary Keys are mangred
6. What is the complixity of List
7. What is good to use tuple and list
7. Why tuple are faster than list
7. Why tuple consume less memory (Tuples are immutable so, It doesn't require extra space to store new objects)
Ans - Tuple has a small memory. List has a large memory. Tuple is stored in a single block of memory. Creating a tuple is faster than creating a list.

Program:
---------

1. find the samllest element in list
2. find the second largest in list
3. find the repeated character/word in string
4. find the sum of all element in tuple/list
5. Find the even/odd in list
6. Find the sub of value in dict keys {'a': 10, 'b': 200, 'c': 300}

1. Fibionic Series
2. Find Second Highest in List

array = [1,2,3,4,5]
new_array = []

size = len(array) #5
for ar in array:
  loc = array.index(ar) #0
  loc += 2
  
  if loc > (size-1):
	loc = loc - size
  new_array[loc] = ar
  
print(new_array)
  

Write a program to create an array and rotate the elements stored in the array by two positions.

The program should first take the input of array size and then the elements of the array. Then program should rotate the elements of the array by 2.

Example Input : 12345 Output : 45123
